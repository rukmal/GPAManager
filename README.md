#GPAManager Documentation
GPA Manager is an application for students to monitor their class grades, minus the stress.
#Description
Being a college student myself, I understand the complexity of managing a class grade with 10 different aspect, ranging from midterms to homework to a final.

I am writing this utility to make the whole process easier.

This utility is still in development, and is not ready for use. It will be deployed on Heroku.
